# Redux Basic

## What is Redux?
Redux is a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments, and are easy to test. While it's mostly used as a state management tool with React, you can use it with any other JavaScript framework or library.

## what is Redux advantages?
- Predictable:

  > Redux helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.

- Centralized:

  > Centralizing your application's state and logic enables powerful capabilities like undo/redo, state persistence, and much more.

- Debuggable:

  > The Redux DevTools make it easy to trace when, where, why, and how your application's state changed. Redux's architecture lets you log changes, use "time-travel debugging", and even send complete error reports to a server.

- Flexible:

  > Redux works with any UI layer, and has a large ecosystem of addons to fit your needs.


## Redux Terms:
- **The State:** the source of truth that drives our app.

- **The View:** a declarative description of the UI based on the current state.

- **The Action:**  the events that occur in the app based on user input, and trigger updates in the state.
