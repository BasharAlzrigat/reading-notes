## Component-Based Architecture

### 1. What is a component?

---
component is a JS class or function that optionally accepts inputs like props for example and returns a React element that describes how a section of the user Interface should appear.

### 2. What are the characteristics of a component?

---
Components are independent and reusable. They serve the same purpose as JS functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
also they come in two types, Class components and Function components.

### 3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

---
 component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.

Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.
also the use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

the overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

and the use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

and easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

## Props (properties)

### What is “props” short for?

---
properties.

### How are props used in React?

---
Props used by define an attribute with value(data)
and pass it to a child component by using Props
then render the Props Data.

### What is the flow of props?

---
one way from parent to child.
